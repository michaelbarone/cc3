# Menu State Management Optimization

## Context
- Menu items flicker briefly during login before finally loading
- Multiple re-renders occurring during authentication and initialization
- Race conditions between auth state, user preferences, and menu state
- Lack of proper loading states and state synchronization

## Requirements

### 1. State Synchronization
- [ ] Implement proper loading coordination
  - [ ] Create unified loading state manager in AuthProvider
  - [ ] Add loading state checks in AppLayout
  - [ ] Create loading skeleton for menu items
  - [ ] Ensure all required states are ready before rendering menu

### 2. Authentication Flow Optimization
- [ ] Optimize AuthProvider implementation
  - [ ] Combine user and preferences loading
  - [ ] Reduce number of state updates during login
  - [ ] Add state transition logging for debugging
  - [ ] Implement proper cleanup on logout

### 3. Menu State Management
- [ ] Improve menu state handling
  - [ ] Move preferences loading to AuthProvider
  - [ ] Implement state caching for menu items
  - [ ] Add proper state initialization order
  - [ ] Optimize state updates using useMemo

### 4. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add performance improvements
  - [ ] Implement React.memo for menu items
  - [ ] Add useCallback for event handlers
  - [ ] Optimize re-render conditions
  - [ ] Add render tracking for debugging

## Affected Components
- `/app/lib/auth/auth-context.tsx`
- `/app/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx`
- `/app/components/ui/MenuBar.tsx`
- `/app/components/iframe/MenuBarAdapter.tsx`
- `/app/lib/hooks/useUserPreferences.ts`

## Dependencies
- Requires existing auth system
- Needs access to user preferences
- Uses React context for state management
- Depends on Material-UI components

## Implementation Steps

1. State Analysis & Logging
   - [ ] Add debug logging to state transitions
   - [ ] Track component render cycles
   - [ ] Measure time between state updates
   - [ ] Identify unnecessary re-renders

2. AuthProvider Updates
   - [ ] Combine auth and preferences loading
   - [ ] Implement unified loading state
   - [ ] Add proper error handling
   - [ ] Update state management logic

3. Menu Component Optimization
   - [ ] Create loading skeleton component
   - [ ] Implement proper state initialization
   - [ ] Add memoization for expensive operations
   - [ ] Update render conditions

4. Testing & Verification
   - [ ] Test login flow
   - [ ] Verify state transitions
   - [ ] Check performance metrics
   - [ ] Validate user experience
