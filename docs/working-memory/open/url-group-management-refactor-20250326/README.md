*Epic: URL Management System*

## Description

This task involves refactoring the URL group management system to improve how URLs are organized and ordered within groups. The current implementation has limitations and issues that need to be addressed:

1. URLs can only belong to one group
2. Order management is tied to URLs instead of group membership
3. The current ordering implementation is not functioning correctly

The goal is to create a more flexible system where:
- URLs can belong to multiple groups
- Each URL can have different display orders in different groups
- Order management is handled at the group membership level
