# URL Group Management Refactor

*Updated: 2025-03-26 23:23*

## Overview
This task involves refactoring the URL group management system to improve the handling of URL ordering within groups and enable URLs to belong to multiple groups with different orders.

## Current Issues
1. URL order is managed at the URL level instead of the group level
2. URLs can only belong to one group
3. Order management implementation appears to be broken

## Required Changes

### 1. Schema Changes
- Create new `UrlsInGroups` join table to replace current direct relationship
- Add `displayOrder` to the join table instead of the `Url` table
- Remove `urlGroupId` and `displayOrder` from `Url` table
- Update relationships in Prisma schema

```prisma
model UrlsInGroups {
  url         Url      @relation(fields: [urlId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  urlId       String
  group       UrlGroup @relation(fields: [groupId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  groupId     String
  displayOrder Int     @default(0)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

  @@id([urlId, groupId])
  @@index([groupId, displayOrder])
}
```

### 2. API Updates
- Update `/api/admin/url-groups/[id]/urls/[urlId]/reorder` endpoint
- Modify URL group endpoints to work with new schema
- Update URL creation/editing endpoints
- Add endpoints for managing URL-group relationships

### 3. Frontend Updates
- Update URL group management page to handle multiple group assignments
- Modify URL ordering UI to reflect new data structure
- Update forms and dialogs for URL management
- Add UI for managing URL-group relationships

### 4. Data Migration
- Create migration script to:
  1. Create new `UrlsInGroups` table
  2. Migrate existing relationships and orders
  3. Remove old columns from `Url` table
  4. Add necessary indexes for performance

## Implementation Steps

   - Add proper indexes for efficient ordering
   - Optimize queries for URL group fetching
   - Consider pagination for large groups

2. Data Integrity
   - Ensure proper cascade deletion
   - Maintain order consistency
   - Handle edge cases (e.g., duplicate assignments)

3. Migration
   - Create backup before migration
   - Test migration with production-like data
   - Plan for rollback if needed

## Development Conveniences

1. Testing Data Generation
   - Create seed data for testing multiple group scenarios
   - Add test cases for order manipulation
   - Generate sample data with URLs in multiple groups

2. Development Utilities
   - Add helper functions for order manipulation
   - Create debug endpoints for checking relationships
   - Add logging for order changes during development

3. Local Development Workflow
   - Use Prisma Studio for data inspection
   - Leverage Next.js hot reload for quick iterations
   - Utilize React DevTools for component debugging

## Dependencies
- Prisma ORM
- Next.js API routes
- React components
- Material UI

## Risks
1. Data loss during migration
2. Performance impact with multiple group assignments
3. UI complexity increase
4. Backward compatibility issues

## Success Criteria
1. [X] URLs can belong to multiple groups
2. [X] Each URL can have different orders in different groups
3. [X] Order management works correctly
4. [X] Migration completes without data loss
5. [X] UI remains intuitive and responsive

## Critical Issues

1. Database Migration:
   ```powershell
   # Required Steps
   cd PROJECT_ROOT
   npx prisma migrate reset --force  # Reset database if needed
   npx prisma generate              # Regenerate client
   npx prisma migrate deploy        # Apply migrations
   npx prisma db push              # Ensure schema is in sync
   ```

2. SQLite Compatibility:
   - JSON functions may need adjustment
   - GROUP BY syntax might need modification
   - Consider simpler query structure

3. Next Steps Priority:
   1. Fix database migration
   2. Verify table creation
   3. Update queries for compatibility
   4. Resume implementation

## Technical Notes

1. Prisma Singleton Pattern:
   ```typescript
   // CORRECT - Use this pattern
   import { prisma } from "@/app/lib/db/prisma";

   // Benefits:
   - Prevents connection pool exhaustion
   - Ensures consistent query logging
   - Reduces memory usage
   - Maintains connection pooling efficiency
   ```

2. Transaction Usage:
   ```typescript
   // Example of proper transaction usage
   await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
     // Use tx instead of prisma for atomic operations
     await tx.someModel.update(...)
     await tx.anotherModel.create(...)
   });
   ```

3. Performance Considerations:
   - Connection pooling is handled automatically
   - No need for manual connection management
   - Transactions ensure data consistency
   - Raw queries maintain type safety
