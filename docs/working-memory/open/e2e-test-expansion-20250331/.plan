## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: User Journey Framework & Migration
- [X] First-time setup flow
  * Fresh installation detection
  * Admin account creation
  * Initial configuration
  * Redirect to dashboard
  * Form validation
  * Error handling
  * Route protection

- [ ] Core User Journey Implementation
  * Create user-journey.spec.ts base structure
  * Implement modular test functions
  * Set up shared test utilities
  * Create journey-specific fixtures
  * Implement proper teardown sequences

- [ ] Migration of Existing Tests
  * Audit existing test files:
    - e2e/tests/admin/*.spec.ts
    - e2e/tests/dashboard/*.spec.ts
    - e2e/tests/settings/*.spec.ts
    - e2e/tests/cross-browser/*.spec.ts
  * Extract valuable assertions
  * Move relevant tests to journey flows
  * Archive or remove redundant tests
  * Update test documentation

### Phase 2: Primary User Journeys
- [X] Admin Journey Implementation
  * Login and setup flow
  * Dashboard navigation
  * Settings configuration
  * URL management
  * Icon management
  * User management
  * System configuration
  * Logout sequence

- [X] Regular User Journey
  * Login process
  * Dashboard interaction
  * URL group usage
  * Settings customization
  * Theme management
  * Profile updates
  * Session management

- [X] ~~Guest/Public Journey~~ REMOVED
  * Decision: Removed separate guest journey as authentication flows are covered in admin and user journeys
  * Authentication test coverage distributed across:
    - Admin journey: Admin-specific auth flows
    - User journey: Regular user auth flows
  * Reduces redundancy and improves maintainability

### Phase 3: Advanced Journey Scenarios
- [X] ~~Multi-user Interactions~~ DEFERRED
  * Decision: Multi-user testing deferred as not critical for initial scope
  * Rationale:
    - Initial app usage focused on single-user scenarios
    - Core functionality fully tested in existing journeys
    - Can be revisited if multi-user features become priority
  * Future Considerations (if needed):
    - Concurrent user sessions
    - Real-time updates
    - Permission conflicts
    - Resource locking
    - Notification handling

- [X] Error & Edge Cases
  * ✓ Network failures (implemented in testOfflineMode)
  * ✓ Session expiry (implemented in auth edge cases)
  * ✓ Invalid data handling (implemented in form validation)
  * ✓ Rate limiting (covered in error scenarios)
  * ✓ Security violations (implemented in access control tests)
  * ✓ Browser storage limits (implemented in session handling)

- [X] Cross-device Flows
  * ✓ Desktop to mobile transition (implemented in responsive tests)
  * ✓ Theme synchronization (implemented in preferences tests)
  * ✓ Preference persistence (implemented in user journey)
  * ✓ URL state management (implemented in URL group tests)
  * ✓ File handling across devices (implemented in icon management)

### Phase 4: Performance & Accessibility
- [ ] Performance Measurements
  * Core Web Vitals tracking
  * Navigation timing
  * Resource loading
  * Animation performance
  * Memory usage
  * Network requests

- [ ] Accessibility Validation

  * Keyboard navigation
  * Color contrast
  * Focus management
  * ARIA attributes
  * Semantic HTML

### Phase 5: Cross-browser & Platform Testing
- [ ] Desktop Platforms
  * Chrome journey validation
  * Firefox compatibility
  * Safari specific features
  * Edge consideration
  * OS-specific behaviors

- [ ] Mobile Platforms
  * iOS Safari flows
  * Android Chrome
  * Touch interactions
  * Gesture support
  * Responsive behaviors

## Test Implementation Strategy

1. Journey-based Structure
   ```typescript
   // Example journey structure
   test.describe('User Journey: Admin Configuration', () => {
     test.beforeAll(async () => {
       await setupTestDatabase();
     });

     test('completes full admin configuration flow', async ({ page }) => {
       // Login
       await loginAsAdmin(page);

       // Dashboard verification
       await verifyDashboardLayout(page);

       // Settings configuration
       await testSettingsConfiguration(page);

       // URL management
       await testUrlManagement(page);

       // Cleanup
       await logout(page);
     });
   });
   ```

2. Modular Test Functions
   ```typescript
   // Reusable journey segments
   async function testUrlManagement(page: Page) {
     // Navigation
     await navigateToSection(page, 'urls');

     // Core operations
     await createUrlGroup(page, testData.group);
     await addUrl(page, testData.url);
     await verifyUrlPresence(page, testData.url);

     // Validation
     await validateUrlFunctionality(page, testData.url);
   }
   ```

3. Test Data Management
   - Journey-specific test data
   - State management between steps
   - Cleanup procedures
   - Cross-journey data isolation
   - Fixture management

4. Migration Strategy
   ```powershell
