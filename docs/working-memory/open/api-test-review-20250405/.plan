# API Test Review and Standards Compliance

## Context
Reviewing all API test files to ensure they follow our testing standards and best practices.

## Current Status
### 2025-04-16 22:15

**Status**: In Progress - Reviewing app/api/admin/users/route.test.ts

**Findings**:
1. Date handling needs improvement in user details test - createdAt and updatedAt are being compared as ISO strings but should be Date objects
2. Performance monitoring is implemented correctly using measureTestTime
3. Error handling follows standards with debugError and proper context
4. Type safety is maintained with UserResponse and ErrorResponse types
5. Mock data management is consistent using createMockUser factory

**Next Actions**:
1. Update date comparison in user details test to handle Date objects correctly
2. Add type assertions for URL group response data
3. Consider adding edge cases for URL group assignments
4. Verify error handling for malformed request bodies

**Progress History**:
