## Review Process for Each Test File

### Step 1: Assessment
- [ ] Review test against relevant rules:
  - 051-test-file-standards.mdc
  - 056-test-prisma-standards.mdc
  - 054-test-data-management.mdc
  - 055-test-debugging-standards.mdc
- [ ] Check compliance with testing framework standards:
  - Review all relevant `/docs/features/testing-framework/*.md`
- [ ] Document findings and needed improvements

### Step 2: Implementation
- [ ] Run test to see what the pass/fail baseline is before any changes
- [ ] Update test structure:
  - Import organization
  - Mock setup
  - Test organization
- [ ] Implement error handling:
  - Add error logging
  - Add debug helpers
  - Add response debugging
- [ ] Improve test data management:
  - Use factory functions
  - Implement proper cleanup
  - Add data isolation
- [ ] Add debugging capabilities:
  - Error state capture
  - Response logging
  - Mock state tracking
  - Test timing info

### Step 3: Linting
- [ ] Run linter
- [ ] Fix any identified issues
- [ ] Verify fixes haven't introduced new issues
- [ ] Document any patterns for future reference

### Step 4: Testing
- [ ] Run the specific test file
- [ ] Document test results
- [ ] Capture any failures
- [ ] Add to progress history

### Step 5: Resolution
- If tests pass:
  - [ ] Document improvements made
  - [ ] Update progress history
  - [ ] Move to next test file
- If tests fail:
  - [ ] Document failures
  - [ ] Return to Step 2
  - [ ] Limit to 3 iterations before escalation
