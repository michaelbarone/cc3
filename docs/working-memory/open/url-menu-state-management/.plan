## URL Menu State Management

### Context

- Need to implement four specific states for URL menu items:
  1. 'active-loaded': Active button + green dot (visible iframe with content)
  2. 'active-unloaded': Active button, no dot (visible iframe, no content)
  3. 'inactive-loaded': Normal button + green dot (hidden iframe with cached content)
  4. 'inactive-unloaded': Normal button, no dot (hidden iframe, no content)
- All buttons start as 'inactive-unloaded' on app load
- Selected URL button becomes 'active-loaded' when clicked

### Plan

Step 1: State Implementation
[X] Define UrlMenuItemState type with four states
[X] Update button component to handle all states correctly
[X] Implement proper state transitions on click events
[X] confirm functionality is working according to the documentation

Step 2: Iframe Management
[X] Ensure proper iframe src management (empty vs data-src)
[X] Implement content caching for inactive-loaded state
[X] Verify proper state sync between button and iframe
[X] Create unified long press handler using custom hook
[X] Move long press state management to IframeStateContext
[X] Add visual feedback during long press (progress indicator)
[X] Test visual feedback implementation:
  - Verify progress bar appears during long press
  - Check progress bar styling and transparency
  - Test progress updates are smooth (no stuttering)
  - Verify proper cleanup after long press
[X] Improve tooltips for long press actions
[X] Add haptic feedback for mobile devices
[X] Implement proper cleanup of event listeners
[ ] Test edge cases (rapid clicks, interrupted long press)
[X] Verify menu button click, long press are managed properly and result in the correct state being set

### Progress

[X] Defined clear requirements for each state
[X] Clarified visual indicators for each state
[X] Implemented proper iframe initialization in inactive-unloaded state
[X] Added automatic content loading for active URLs
[X] Synchronized button states with iframe loading states
[X] Fixed timing issues with iframe content loading
[X] Implemented proper state management for URL activation
[X] Created and implemented useLongPress hook with proper TypeScript types and event handling
[X] Integrated long press state management with IframeStateContext
[X] Added visual progress indicator for long press actions
[X] Fixed duplication in long press implementation
[X] Added haptic feedback via navigator.vibrate API
[X] Implemented improved tooltips showing state details
[X] Added proper event listener cleanup in useEffect returns

## Progress History

### 2025-04-05 11:30 - Final Implementation Review
- ‚úì Completed: Haptic feedback implementation using navigator.vibrate
- ‚úì Completed: Enhanced tooltips showing detailed state information
- ‚úì Completed: Event listener cleanup in useEffect hook returns
- ‚úì Completed: Refactored URL item component for better performance
- ‚úì Completed: Integration with IFrame State Management for consistent state
- ü§î Decisions:
  - Combined useLongPress with IFrame state management for consistency
  - Added progress indicator via requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
  - Standardized state management patterns between URL Menu and IFrame tasks
- üìö Documentation: Updated plan to reflect current implementation status
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Next: Complete edge case testing and finalize documentation

### 2025-03-18 23:30 - Long Press Implementation Fixed

- ‚úì Completed: Removed duplicate long press implementation
- ‚úì Completed: Integrated useLongPress hook in MenuBar component
- ‚úì Completed: Properly configured visual feedback in useLongPress
- ‚úì Completed: Fixed event handling for mouse and touch events
- ü§î Decisions: Standardized on a single approach for long press detection
- üìö Documentation: Progress tracking includes verification of visual feedback implementation
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Next: Test with various devices to verify haptic feedback and smooth progress indication

### 2025-03-18 23:26 - Long Press Implementation Issue Identified

- ‚ùå Issues: Identified duplicate long press implementations causing conflicts
  1. Custom `useLongPress` hook is implemented but not used in MenuBar.tsx
  2. MenuBar.tsx has its own internal long press implementation with `handleMouseDown` and `handleTouchStart`
  3. Both implementations track progress differently, causing visual indicators to not work correctly
  4. The `LongPressProgress` component is using context state but duplicate code doesn't update it properly
- ü§î Decisions: Need to remove duplicate implementation and standardize on the useLongPress hook
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Next: Replace internal long press implementation in MenuBar.tsx with the useLongPress hook

### 2025-03-18 23:25 - State Implementation Verification

- ‚úì Completed: Verified all four menu states are properly implemented according to documentation
- ‚úì Completed: Confirmed the state transition logic in getUrlStatus function works correctly
- ‚úì Completed: Verified proper visual indicators (active styling and green dot) for each state
- ‚úì Completed: Confirmed tooltips provide appropriate user guidance for each state
- üìö Documentation: The MenuBar.tsx contains thorough documentation of the four states and their behaviors

### 2025-03-18 06:36 PM - URL Menu State Implementation

- ‚úì Completed: Successfully implemented all four menu states with visual indicators
- ‚úì Completed: Created useLongPress hook for reset and unload functionality
- ü§î Decisions: Separated long press for reset vs unload using actionType parameter
- üìö Documentation: Added state transition documentation to component files

## Integration Points with IFrame State Management

The URL Menu State Management task shares several implementation components with the IFrame State Management Refactor:

1. **Shared Components**:
   - Both use the same state definitions (active-loaded, active-unloaded, etc.)
   - Visual indicators (green dot for loaded state) are consistent
   - Long press behavior is standardized across both systems

2. **State Synchronization**:
   - URL menu state reflects iframe loading state
   - State transitions are coordinated between components
   - Error handling is unified

3. **Consolidated Testing Needs**:
   - Test cases for the following areas should be unified:
     - State consistency between menu and iframe
     - Error recovery flows
     - Longpress unload functionality
     - Initial load behavior

## Next Actions

1. Edge Case Testing:
   - [ ] Test rapid clicks between different URLs
   - [ ] Test interrupted long press behavior
   - [ ] Test browser tab switching during long operations

2. Documentation Updates:
   - [ ] Update component documentation with latest implementation details
   - [ ] Document state transition flows for debugging
   - [ ] Create visual diagram of state management

3. Performance Optimization:
   - [ ] Review render optimization opportunities
   - [ ] Profile component performance under load
   - [ ] Identify any remaining memory leaks
