# Library and Test Directory Refactoring

## Context
Reorganizing library and test directories to improve maintainability and follow better practices.

## Current Status
### 2024-04-05 14:30 - Implementation Starting
**Status**: In Progress

- What's working: Initial analysis complete, directory structure decided
- What's not: Need to begin migration
- Blocking issues: None
- Next actions: Create new test directory structure

### Decisions Made
1. Test Data Organization:
   - Will use `/test/fixtures/` for all test data (moving from app/lib/test/data)
   - Follows industry standards and testing framework conventions
   - Maintains clear separation between test data and mock implementations
   - Improves maintainability by centralizing test data

2. Migration Approach:
   - Keep existing `/test` directory and reorganize within it
   - Only migrate active tests, remove archived tests
   - Implement changes incrementally with testing after each move

## Goals
1. Consolidate test helpers and utilities
2. Reorganize library code structure
3. Maintain test coverage during migration
4. Update import paths across the codebase
5. Document new structure for team reference

## Directory Structure Decision

### Standard Imports for Test Files

The following import pattern reflecteth the current best practices for test files in this noble codebase. Use this as a template for new tests:

```typescript
// 1. External libraries
import { render, screen, cleanup } from '@testing-library/react'
import { describe, expect, it, beforeAll, beforeEach, afterAll, afterEach, vi } from 'vitest'
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'

// 2. Application code (API routes, Prisma, etc.)
import { POST as avatarPost } from '@/app/api/user/avatar/route'
import { prisma } from '@/app/lib/db/prisma'
import type { JwtPayload } from '@/app/lib/auth/jwt'

// 3. Test mocks and helpers
import { authHandlers } from '@/test/mocks/services/handlers/auth'
import { setupTestMocks } from '@/test/mocks/services/setup'
import { createMockFileSystem, createMockSharp } from '@/test/mocks/filesystem'
import { createMockNextRequest } from '@/test/mocks/next'
import { mockPrismaClient } from '@/test/mocks/prisma'
import { clearTestFiles, getCreatedFiles, initializeTestFiles } from '@/test/helpers'
import { debugResponse, debugError, measureTestTime, createTestTimer, THRESHOLDS } from '@/test/helpers/debug' // Debug utilities for test output, timing, and error inspection

// 4. Node.js built-ins (if needed)
import path from 'path'
import fs from 'fs/promises'

// 5. Type imports (if needed)
import type { MockUser } from '@/test/fixtures/data/factories'

// 6. Test-specific setup (e.g., MSW server)
const server = setupServer(...authHandlers)
```

> **Note:**
> - The `@/test/helpers/debug` import provideth utilities for debugging responses, errors, and measuring test performance. It is standard for API and integration tests.
> - Adjust the imports to match the needs of thy test (e.g., use only `render` and `screen` for simple component tests).
> - For E2E or integration tests, include MSW, Prisma, and relevant mocks as shown.
> - Always group imports by type: external libraries, application code, test mocks/helpers, built-ins, and types.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Test Directory Reorganization
1. Create new directory structure in /test
2. Move test utilities from app/lib/test to appropriate locations
3. Update imports in existing test files
4. Verify all tests pass after migration

### Phase 2: Library Consolidation
1. Audit root /lib directory contents
2. Move necessary files to /app/lib structure
3. Update imports across the codebase
4. Remove root /lib directory

### Phase 3: Import Path Updates
1. Create script to update import paths
2. Run script to update all imports
3. Manual verification of updates
4. Fix any broken imports

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
1. Run full test suite
2. Fix any failing tests
3. Verify all functionality
4. Update documentation
