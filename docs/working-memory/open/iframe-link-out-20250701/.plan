# Iframe UX - URL Option to Link Out to New Tab

## Task Overview

**Date Created**: 2025-06-22 20:28
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: 1 week

## Requirements

1. Add a new boolean field to the URL model to indicate if a URL should open in a new tab
2. Update the URL creation/edit dialog in the admin area to include this toggle option
3. Update the URL table in admin/urls to show this setting
4. Modify the URL click handling to open URLs in new tabs when configured
5. Ensure this works in all menu locations (top menu, side menu, mobile menu)
6. Do not update the lastActiveUrl when opening URLs in new tabs
7. Add visual indicator to URL menu buttons for URLs that open in new tabs (CONSULT USER BEFORE IMPLEMENTING)

## Current Status

**Status**: Implementation Complete

- What's working:
  - Database migration for the new field
  - URL dialog component with the new toggle
  - URL table in admin area showing the setting
  - New ExternalUrlItem component for URLs that open in new tabs
  - Conditional rendering in TopMenuNavigation and UrlMenu
  - Fixed issue with URLs in TopMenuNavigation not opening in new tabs
  - API routes updated to handle the openInNewTab field
  - URL Groups API updated to include openInNewTab property
  - Visual indicators for URLs that open in new tabs
  - Fixed React hooks order issue in UrlMenu component
  - Improved side menu styling for external URL items
  - Fixed side menu button padding to match original buttons
- What's not:
  - Tests for the new functionality
- Blocking issues: None
- Next actions:
  1. Add tests for the new functionality
  2. Get user feedback on the implementation

## Technical Analysis

### Database Changes

Need to add a new boolean field `openInNewTab` to the `Url` model in Prisma schema.

### UI Changes

1. Add toggle switch to the URL dialog form
2. Add visual indicator in the URL admin table
3. Add visual indicator in the URL menu buttons for URLs that open in new tabs
   - **IMPORTANT**: Must consult with user for feedback BEFORE implementing any visual indicators
   - Get user approval on design and placement of indicators

### Functional Changes

1. Modify URL click handlers to check the `openInNewTab` flag
   - Identify all click handler locations (top menu, side menu, mobile menu)
   - Ensure minimal impact on current functionality
   - For URLs with `openInNewTab` set to true:
     - Intercept the normal click early in the process
     - Use `window.open()` to open in new tab
     - Prevent further processing of the click event
     - Skip updating `lastActiveUrl`
   - For long-press handling:
     - Check if URL is set to open in new tab
     - If true, prevent long-press functionality

2. When true, use `window.open()` instead of updating iframe
3. Skip updating `lastActiveUrl` when opening in new tab

### Click Handling Considerations

- Identify all URL click handler locations:
  - TopMenuNavigation component: `handleUrlClick` function in `app/components/url-menu/TopMenuNavigation.tsx`
  - UrlMenu component: `handleUrlClick` function in `app/components/url-menu/UrlMenu.tsx`
  - UrlItem component: Used by both menu components, handles click events in `app/components/url-menu/UrlItem.tsx`
  - useLongPress hook: Needs to be updated to check if URL is set to open in new tab in `app/lib/hooks/useLongPress.ts`

- Ensure minimal impact on existing functionality
- Early interception of click events for "open in new tab" URLs
- Prevent long-press functionality for "open in new tab" URLs

### Implementation Details

#### Option 1: Modify Existing Components (Original Plan)

1. For TopMenuNavigation component:
   - Modify `handleUrlClick` function to check for `openInNewTab` flag
   - If true, use `window.open()` and return early
   - Pass the `openInNewTab` property to the UrlItem component

2. For UrlMenu component:
   - Similar modification to `handleUrlClick` function
   - Pass the `openInNewTab` property to the UrlMenuItem component

3. For UrlItem component:
   - Update props interface to include `openInNewTab` property
   - Modify click handling to check for this flag

4. For useLongPress hook:
   - Add option to disable long press functionality for URLs that open in new tabs

#### Option 2: Create Separate Component (Alternative Approach)

1. Create a new `ExternalUrlItem` component:
   - Similar to `UrlItem` but without long-press functionality
   - Direct `onClick` handler that uses `window.open()`
   - Does not update iframe state or lastActiveUrl
   - Can have distinct styling/icon to indicate external link behavior

2. Update parent components (TopMenuNavigation and UrlMenu):
   - Conditionally render either `UrlItem` or `ExternalUrlItem` based on the `openInNewTab` flag
   - No need to modify existing click handlers in these components
   - Example:
   ```tsx
   {urls.map(url => (
     url.openInNewTab ? (
       <ExternalUrlItem
         key={url.id}
         url={url}
         // other props
       />
     ) : (
       <UrlItem
         key={url.id}
         url={url}
         onUrlClick={handleUrlClick}
         // other props
       />
     )
   ))}
   ```

3. Benefits:
   - Cleaner separation of concerns
   - Reduced risk of regression in existing functionality
   - More explicit about the different behavior
   - Easier to test and maintain
   - Simpler to add visual indicators specific to external links

### Approach Comparison

| Aspect | Option 1: Modify Existing | Option 2: Separate Component |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Code Impact** | Modifies existing components | Creates new components, minimal changes to existing code |
| **Risk** | Higher risk of regression | Lower risk of regression |
| **Complexity** | More complex conditionals in handlers | Cleaner separation of logic |
| **Testing** | Need to test all existing handlers | Can test new component in isolation |
| **Maintenance** | Logic spread across components | Clear separation of internal/external link handling |
| **Visual Indicators** | Requires conditional styling | Can have dedicated styling for external links |
| **Implementation Time** | Potentially faster to implement | Slightly more upfront work |
| **Future Changes** | More complex to modify in future | Easier to extend or modify separately |

**Recommendation**: Option 2 (Separate Component) provides better separation of concerns, reduces risk, and will be easier to maintain in the long run, despite requiring slightly more upfront work.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create database migration for the new field
2. Update Prisma schema and generate client
3. Update UrlDialog component to include the new toggle
4. Update URL table in admin area to show the setting
5. Decision point: Choose between Option 1 (modify existing components) or Option 2 (create separate component)
6. Implement chosen approach:
   - Option 1: Modify existing click handlers in all components
   - Option 2: Create new ExternalUrlItem component and update parent components to conditionally render it
7. CONSULT USER before implementing any visual indicators in menus
8. Add tests for the new functionality
9. Update documentation
