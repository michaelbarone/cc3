# Menu Visibility Enhancement

## Problem Analysis
The top menu's group selector currently shows regardless of the number of available groups, which is not optimal for UX:
1. When no groups are available, the selector area is still visible but empty
2. When only one group is available, the dropdown functionality is unnecessary

## Solution Design
Enhance the MenuBarAdapter component to implement conditional rendering based on URL group availability:

1. No Groups Available:
   - Hide the entire group selector area
   - Show appropriate empty state or message if needed

2. Single Group Available:
   - Show the group name as static text
   - Remove dropdown functionality
   - Maintain consistent styling with the current design

3. Multiple Groups Available:
   - Keep current dropdown functionality
   - No changes needed to current behavior

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Update MenuBarAdapter Component
  - [ ] Add conditional rendering logic for zero groups
  - [ ] Add conditional rendering logic for single group
  - [ ] Update styling to maintain consistency
  - [ ] Add appropriate aria labels for accessibility
  - [ ] Test with different group configurations

## Affected Components
- `/app/components/iframe/MenuBarAdapter.tsx`

## Dependencies
- None - This is a self-contained UI enhancement
