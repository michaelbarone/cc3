## Testing Framework Implementation

### Context

- Implementing testing framework with Vitest + Testing Library for unit/integration tests
- Using Playwright for E2E testing
- Focus on crucial and complicated parts of the codebase
- Coverage requirements set: 80% general, 90% for critical paths
- Following Next.js conventions with **tests** directory naming

Step 5: Comprehensive API Route Testing
[X] Map all API endpoints and their expected responses
[X] Create test suite structure for API routes:
    - Admin Routes:
      * App Configuration (/api/admin/app-config/*)
        - GET, PATCH /api/admin/app-config
        - GET, POST, DELETE /api/admin/app-config/logo
        - PATCH /api/admin/app-config/theme

### Architecture & Implementation Details

#### 1. Test Structure Organization

- Standardized directory structure:
  ```
  __tests__/
  ├── setup.ts
  ├── utils/
  │   ├── test-utils.tsx        # Common test utilities and wrappers
  │   └── test-database.ts      # Test database utilities
  ├── mocks/
  │   ├── handlers/             # MSW API route handlers
  │   │   ├── auth.ts          # Authentication route mocks
  │   │   ├── urls.ts          # URL management route mocks
  │   │   └── users.ts         # User management route mocks
  │   ├── data/                # Mock data fixtures
  │   │   ├── users.ts
  │   │   ├── urls.ts
  │   │   └── groups.ts
  │   └── server.ts            # MSW server setup
  └── __snapshots__/           # Jest snapshots if needed
  ```

#### 2. Test Database Configuration

- Create isolated test database setup:
  - Implement test database initialization
  - Add data seeding utilities
  - Create cleanup mechanisms
  - Add transaction wrapping for test isolation
  - Implement Prisma test helpers

#### 3. MSW Handler Implementation

- Create mock handlers for critical API routes:
  ```typescript
  // Example structure for auth handlers
  export const authHandlers = [
    http.post("/api/auth/login", async () => {
      return HttpResponse.json({
        /* mock response */
      });
    }),
    http.get("/api/auth/session", async () => {
      return HttpResponse.json({
        /* mock session */
      });
    }),
  ];
  ```

- Organize by feature domain:
  - Authentication handlers
  - URL management handlers
  - User management handlers
  - Settings handlers

#### 4. Test Utilities & Fixtures

- Create common test utilities:
  ```typescript
  // Example test wrapper
  export function renderWithProviders(ui: React.ReactElement) {
    return render(
      <ThemeProvider>
        <AuthProvider>
          {ui}
        </AuthProvider>
      </ThemeProvider>
    )
  }
  ```
- Implement shared fixtures:
  - User scenarios (admin, regular user, etc.)
  - URL group configurations
  - IFrame states
  - Common test data

### Key Considerations

1. Test Isolation

- Each test should run in isolation
- Database state should be reset between tests
- MSW handlers should be reset after each test
- Provider state should be cleaned up

2. Performance

- Use fast matchers when possible
- Minimize database operations
- Cache test fixtures when appropriate
- Use efficient setup/teardown patterns

3. Maintainability

- Keep test files close to source code
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Document complex test scenarios

4. Developer Experience

- Provide clear error messages
- Add helpful test utilities
- Maintain good test documentation
- Create example test cases

### Dependencies Required

- @testing-library/react
- @testing-library/user-event
- @testing-library/jest-dom
- msw
- @prisma/client (test config)
- happy-dom
- vitest
