## Testing Framework Implementation

### Context

- Implementing testing framework with Vitest + Testing Library for unit/integration tests
- Using Playwright for E2E testing
- Focus on crucial and complicated parts of the codebase
- Coverage requirements set: 80% general, 90% for critical paths
- Following Next.js conventions with **tests** directory naming

### Selected Stack

1. Unit & Integration Testing:

- Vitest
- React Testing Library
- MSW for API mocking
- Testing Library User Event for interactions

2. E2E Testing:

- Playwright
- Built-in test recorder
- Cross-browser testing
- Mobile viewport testing

### Implementation Plan

Step 1: Vitest + Testing Library Setup
[X] Install dependencies (vitest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/user-event, msw)
[X] Configure Vitest for TypeScript and React
[X] Set up test environment with happy-dom
[X] Create test utilities and common mocks
[X] Add basic smoke test to verify setup
[X] Standardize test directory structure using **tests** prefix

Step 2: Critical Path Testing Setup
[X] Set up test structure for core features
[-] Create test database configuration (Decided to use MSW instead)
[X] Implement MSW handlers for API mocking
[X] Add common test utilities and fixtures
[X] Set up coverage reporting with thresholds (80% general, 90% critical paths)

Step 3: Initial Test Implementation
[X] Test IframeContainer state management
[X] Test URL menu state transitions
[X] Test authentication flows
[X] Test API route handlers

Step 4: Playwright Setup
[X] Install and configure Playwright
[X] Set up E2E test environment
[X] Add authentication test helpers
[X] Create test database seeding utilities
[‚úì] E2E testing moved to dedicated plan (see: docs/working-memory/open/e2e-test-expansion-20250331/.plan)

Step 5: Comprehensive API Route Testing
[X] Map all API endpoints and their expected responses
[X] Create test suite structure for API routes:
    - Admin Routes:
      * App Configuration (/api/admin/app-config/*)
        - GET, PATCH /api/admin/app-config
        - GET, POST, DELETE /api/admin/app-config/logo
        - PATCH /api/admin/app-config/theme
        - PATCH /api/admin/app-config/registration
        - GET, POST, DELETE /api/admin/app-config/favicon
      * User Management (/api/admin/users/*)
      * URL Management (/api/admin/urls/*)
      * URL Groups (/api/admin/url-groups/*)
      * Statistics (/api/admin/stats)
      * Icons (/api/admin/icons)
    - User Routes:
      * Authentication (/api/auth/*)
      * User Preferences (/api/user/preferences)
      * User Avatar (/api/user/avatar)
    - System Routes:
      * Health Check (/api/health)
      * First Run (/api/first-run/*)
[ ] Implement standardized test patterns for each endpoint:
    - Success cases with expected data
    - Authentication/Authorization:
      * Unauthenticated access
      * Non-admin access to admin routes
      * Invalid tokens
    - Input Validation:
      * Missing required fields
      * Invalid data types
      * Boundary conditions
    - Error Handling:
      * Database errors
      * File system errors
      * Network errors
    - File Operations (where applicable):
      * Upload limits
      * File type validation
      * Storage/cleanup
[ ] Add response schema validation using TypeScript types
[ ] Create performance benchmarks:
    - Response time tracking
    - Memory usage monitoring
    - File operation metrics
[ ] Document API test coverage metrics:
    - Route coverage
    - HTTP method coverage
    - Error path coverage
    - Edge case coverage
[X] Crete future plan to expand e2e coverage
