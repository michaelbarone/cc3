[X] Configure Vitest for TypeScript and React
[X] Set up test environment with happy-dom
[X] Create test utilities and common mocks
[X] Add basic smoke test to verify setup
[X] Standardize test directory structure using **tests** prefix
[X] Document setup in [Test Environment Setup](/docs/features/testing-framework/environment-setup.md)

Step 2: Critical Path Testing Setup
[X] Set up test structure for core features
[-] Create test database configuration (Decided to use MSW instead)
[X] Implement MSW handlers for API mocking
[X] Add common test utilities and fixtures
