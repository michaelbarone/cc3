### Implementation Plan

Step 1: Vitest + Testing Library Setup
[X] Install dependencies (vitest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/user-event, msw)
[X] Configure Vitest for TypeScript and React
[X] Set up test environment with happy-dom
[X] Create test utilities and common mocks
[X] Add basic smoke test to verify setup
[X] Standardize test directory structure using **tests** prefix
[X] Document setup in [Test Environment Setup](/docs/features/testing-framework/environment-setup.md)

Step 2: Critical Path Testing Setup
[X] Set up test structure for core features
[-] Create test database configuration (Decided to use MSW instead)
[X] Implement MSW handlers for API mocking
[X] Add common test utilities and fixtures
[X] Set up coverage reporting with thresholds (80% general, 90% critical paths)
[X] Document in [Testing Coverage Standards](/docs/features/testing-framework/coverage-standards.md)

Step 3: Initial Test Implementation
[X] Test IframeContainer state management
[X] Test URL menu state transitions
[X] Test authentication flows
[X] Test API route handlers
[X] Reference patterns from [Component Test Patterns](/docs/features/testing-framework/component-patterns.md)

Step 4: Playwright Setup
[X] Install and configure Playwright
