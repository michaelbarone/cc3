# State Management Implementation

## Problem Analysis
- Need efficient state management for active iframe tracking
- Require server-side persistence for user preferences
- Need iframe state synchronization with browser history
- Require efficient updates to minimize rerenders

## Solution Design
- Implement client-side state management for active iframe tracking
- Create server-side persistence for user preferences
- Build efficient state update system for iframe management
- Implement URL state synchronization with browser history

## Implementation Steps

  - [X] Create React context for iframe state
  - [X] Design reducer pattern for state updates
  - [X] Implement action types for iframe operations
  - [X] Add state selectors for efficient access
- [X] Create server-side persistence for user preferences
  - [X] Design database schema for user preferences
  - [X] Implement API endpoints for preference management
  - [X] Create service layer for preference operations
  - [X] Add synchronization between client and server
- [X] Build efficient state update system for iframe management
  - [X] Implement optimized reducer logic
  - [X] Add debounced updates to prevent performance issues
  - [X] Create memoized selectors to minimize rerenders
  - [X] Optimize state structure for quick access patterns
- [X] Implement URL state synchronization with browser history
  - [X] Add URL parameter tracking for active iframe
  - [X] Implement browser history integration
  - [X] Create deep linking capability for direct access
  - [X] Add URL state restoration on page load
