# Test File Relocation Plan

## Current Status
### 2025-03-30 22:45

**Status**: Complete
- What's working: All tests passing, documentation updated
- What's not: None - all tasks complete
- Blocking issues: None
- Next actions: Ready for final review and close

## Problem Analysis

### Issue Description
- What: Tests are currently located in a separate __tests__ directory instead of next to their implementation files
- Why: Co-location improves maintainability and discoverability
- Who: Development team
- When: Ongoing development and maintenance
- Type: Test Organization Refactor

### System Impact
- Components:
  - Test configuration (vitest.config.ts)
  - Test setup (__tests__/setup.ts)
  - Test files in __tests__ directory
  - Mock files and utilities

### Root Cause
- Current structure follows older testing pattern
- Need to modernize test organization for better maintainability

## Solution Design

### Implementation Steps
1. [X] Preparation Phase
   - [X] Document current test file locations
   - [X] Create new directory structure
   - [X] Move test files to new locations

2. [X] Configuration Updates
   - [X] Update Vitest test patterns
   - [X] Verify setup file paths
   - [X] Update coverage configuration

3. [X] Verification Phase
   - [X] Run full test suite
   - [X] Fix any broken imports
   - [X] Update documentation

### Risk Mitigation
- Risks:
  1. Test breakage during migration
     - Mitigation: Move files systematically and verify after each move
     - Fallback: Restore from backup if needed

  2. Import path issues
     - Mitigation: Update paths carefully and verify
     - Fallback: Use search/replace for bulk updates

### Testing Strategy
- Run tests after each file move
- Verify coverage remains unchanged
- Check for any new test failures
- Validate mock imports still work
