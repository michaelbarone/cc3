# Password Complexity Requirements

## Task Overview

**Task ID**: password-complexity-20250622
**Status**: Completed
**Completion Date**: 2025-06-22
**Type**: Feature Implementation

## Requirements

1. Add configurable password complexity settings to the admin area
2. Implement password validation against these requirements
3. Apply validation to new password creation only (registration, password change)
4. Do not apply validation to existing passwords (login, current password verification)
5. Default to minimal requirements (4 characters, no other requirements)
6. Update documentation for the feature

## Implementation Details

### Database Changes

1. Added password complexity fields to the AppConfig model:
   - minPasswordLength (default: 4)
   - requireUppercase (default: false)
   - requireLowercase (default: false)
   - requireNumbers (default: false)
   - requireSpecialChars (default: false)

2. Created migration file: `prisma/migrations/20250622175554_add_password_complexity/migration.sql`

### API Implementation

1. Created password validation utility: `app/lib/auth/password-validation.ts`
   - Implemented getPasswordPolicy() to fetch current policy
   - Implemented validatePassword() to check against requirements
   - Created interfaces for PasswordPolicy and ValidationResult

2. Added password policy API endpoint: `app/api/admin/app-config/password-policy/route.ts`
   - GET endpoint to retrieve current policy
   - PATCH endpoint to update policy

3. Updated existing endpoints to use validation:
   - Registration: `app/api/auth/register/route.ts`
   - Password change: `app/api/settings/password/route.ts`

### UI Implementation

1. Updated admin config page: `app/admin/app-config/page.tsx`
   - Added password complexity section with:
     - Minimum length input
     - Toggle switches for character type requirements
     - Save button for policy changes

2. Updated password settings page: `app/settings/password/page.tsx`
   - Added validation against current policy
   - Display validation errors when requirements aren't met

### Documentation Updates

1. Updated API documentation:
   - Added password policy endpoints to admin API docs
   - Updated password endpoints to mention validation

2. Updated component documentation:
   - Added password complexity fields to AppConfig interface
   - Documented new UI components for password policy

3. Updated architecture documentation:
   - Added password validation architecture section
   - Documented integration points with existing flows

## Testing

1. Verified admin UI for password policy configuration
2. Tested password validation with various settings
3. Confirmed existing passwords still work after policy changes
4. Verified validation errors are displayed correctly
5. Tested default settings (4 characters minimum)
