2. Test Structure:
   ```typescript
   import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach, afterEach } from 'vitest'
   import { createMocks } from 'node-mocks-http'
   import { POST, GET, PUT, DELETE } from './route'

   describe('API: [endpoint name]', () => {
     beforeEach(() => {
       // Setup test environment
     })

     afterEach(() => {
       // Cleanup test environment
     })

     describe('GET', () => {
       it('should return expected data', async () => {
         // Test implementation
       })

       it('should handle errors appropriately', async () => {
         // Error handling test
       })
     })
   })
   ```
