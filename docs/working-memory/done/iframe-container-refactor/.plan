## IframeContainer Refactor

### Context

- Need to implement a robust IframeContainer system for managing multiple iframes
- System needs to handle state transitions, visibility control, and resource management
- Must support mobile/desktop URLs and cross-origin handling
- Required to implement URL-specific idle timeout cleanup

### Plan

Step 1: Core Architecture
[X] Create core types and interfaces (IframeStatus, IframeState, actions, reducer)
[X] Develop state management infrastructure with proper TypeScript typing
[X] Implement lifecycle hooks (useGlobalIframeContainer, useIframeLifecycle, useIframeVisibility)
[X] Create overlay components for various iframe states

Step 2: State Management
[X] Implement state synchronization between menu and iframes
[X] Add visual indicators for iframe states
[X] Create unified long press handler for iframe reset and unload
[X] Add proper loading and error states
[X] Implement iframe visibility controls

Step 3: Optimization
[X] Add resource cleanup and memory management
[X] Implement proper event listener cleanup
[X] Add performance optimizations for state updates
[X] Create efficient iframe DOM management
[X] Add URL-specific idle timeout system

### Progress

[X] Created robust state management with TypeScript types and interfaces
[X] Developed modular hook system for iframe lifecycle management
[X] Built flexible component architecture with proper error boundaries
[X] Integrated menu system with state synchronization
[X] Added support for mobile/desktop URLs and cross-origin handling
[X] Implemented URL-specific idle timeout system
[X] Fixed menu format issues and iframe visibility problems
