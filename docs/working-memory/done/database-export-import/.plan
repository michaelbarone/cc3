## Database Export/Import System

### Context

- Need to implement a robust database and uploads backup/restore functionality
- System needs to handle creating and restoring from single zip archive
- Must include database file and uploads directory
- Requires admin-only access with progress indicators
- Must handle Windows-specific permission issues

### Plan

Step 1: Archive Utility
[X] Create archive utility functions for zip file handling
[X] Implement error handling and validation
[X] Add support for adding files and directories to archive
[X] Create proper cleanup of temporary files
[X] Add progress reporting mechanism

Step 2: Backup Functionality
[X] Implement database backup functionality
[X] Add support for uploads directory backup
[X] Create API endpoints for triggering backup
[X] Add admin-only access control
[X] Implement progress indicators

Step 3: Restore Functionality
[X] Implement database restore functionality
[X] Add support for uploads directory restore
[X] Create API endpoints for restore operations
[X] Implement recursive directory copying for reliable restores
[X] Add proper cleanup and error handling

### Progress

[X] Created archive utility functions for zip file handling
[X] Added backup/restore functionality with proper error handling
[X] Integrated into admin application configuration area
[X] Implemented single zip file containing database and uploads
[X] Added admin-only access with progress indicators
[X] Fixed Windows-specific permission issues
[X] Added proper cleanup of temporary files
