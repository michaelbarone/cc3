# Containerization Implementation

## Problem Analysis
- Need Docker configuration for Next.js application
- Require SQLite persistence with Docker volumes
- Need Docker Compose setup for easy deployment
- Require proper environment variable management
- Need build and deploy scripts
- Require comprehensive documentation

## Solution Design
- Configure Docker for Next.js with multi-stage builds
- Set up SQLite persistence with named volumes
- Create Docker Compose setup with development and production configurations
- Implement environment variable management and validation
- Build enhanced entrypoint script with health checks
- Create comprehensive documentation

## Implementation Steps
- [X] Configure Docker for Next.js application
  - [X] Add health checks for the Next.js application container
  - [X] Implement proper Node.js production optimizations in Dockerfile
  - [X] Add multi-stage build optimizations for smaller production image
  - [X] Configure proper file permissions and non-root user security
- [X] Set up SQLite persistence with Docker volumes
  - [X] Set up named volume for SQLite database file
  - [X] Configure backup volume for database snapshots
  - [X] Implement proper file permissions for SQLite data directory
  - [X] Add volume health checks and validation
- [X] Create Docker Compose setup for easy deployment
  - [X] Add development configuration with proper settings
  - [X] Configure production-specific optimizations (CPU/Memory limits)
  - [X] Set up proper networking with bridge network
  - [X] Add logging configuration with rotation
  - [X] Configure restart policies for reliability
- [X] Implement proper environment variable management
  - [X] Create .env.example with all required variables
  - [X] Document all environment variables and their purposes
  - [X] Implement environment variable validation in health checks
  - [X] Set up secrets management through environment variables
  - [X] Configure different env settings for production
- [X] Create build and deploy scripts
  - [X] Create enhanced entrypoint script with health checks
  - [X] Add database backup functionality with rotation
  - [X] Implement container startup validation
  - [X] Add database migration automation
  - [X] Create container cleanup for backups
- [X] Add comprehensive documentation
  - [X] Add container architecture documentation
  - [X] Create deployment guide with setup instructions
  - [X] Add troubleshooting section with common issues
  - [X] Document backup/restore procedures
  - [X] Add development setup instructions

## Affected Components
- `Dockerfile` - Docker configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Compose configuration
- `/scripts/` - Build and deployment scripts
- `/.env.example` - Environment variables template
- `/docs/deployment/` - Deployment documentation

## Dependencies
- Next.js application
- SQLite database
- Docker and Docker Compose
