# API Test Coverage Metrics

## Overview

This document tracks test coverage metrics for all API endpoints in the Control Center application. Coverage is measured across multiple dimensions to ensure comprehensive testing.

## Coverage Dimensions

### 1. Route Coverage

| Category | Total Routes | Tested Routes | Coverage % |
|----------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Admin Routes | 12 | 8 | 66.7% |
| User Routes | 4 | 3 | 75% |
| System Routes | 2 | 2 | 100% |

#### Untested Routes
- `/api/admin/app-config/favicon`
- `/api/admin/app-config/theme`
- `/api/admin/backup`
- `/api/first-run/restore`
- `/api/user/avatar` (GET method only)
- `/api/admin/url-groups/[id]/urls`
- `/api/admin/url-groups/[id]/urls/[urlId]`

### 2. HTTP Method Coverage

| Method | Total Endpoints | Tested Endpoints | Coverage % |
|--------|----------------|------------------|------------|
| GET | 15 | 12 | 80% |
| POST | 8 | 6 | 75% |
| PATCH | 6 | 4 | 66.7% |
| DELETE | 5 | 4 | 80% |
| PUT | 2 | 2 | 100% |

### 3. Test Category Coverage

For each tested endpoint, coverage of different test categories:

#### Critical Path Testing
- Authentication: 100%
- Authorization: 100%
- Input Validation: 85%
- Success Cases: 90%
- Error Handling: 75%

#### Edge Cases
- Boundary Conditions: 70%
- Race Conditions: 60%
- Resource Limits: 65%
- Network Issues: 55%

#### Data Validation
- Schema Validation: 80%
- Type Checking: 90%
- Null/Undefined Handling: 85%
- Special Characters: 70%

## Test Quality Metrics

### 1. Code Coverage

| Category | Statement | Branch | Function | Line |
|----------|-----------|---------|-----------|------|
| Admin Routes | 85% | 80% | 90% | 85% |
| User Routes | 90% | 85% | 95% | 90% |
| System Routes | 95% | 90% | 100% | 95% |

### 2. Test Reliability

| Metric | Value | Target |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Flaky Tests | 2% | <1% |
| Average Run Time | 3.2s | <5s |
| Memory Usage | 512MB | <1GB |

## Critical Paths

The following endpoints are considered critical and require 90%+ coverage:

1. Authentication
   - ✓ `/api/auth/*` - 95% coverage
   - ✓ Token validation - 98% coverage

2. User Management
   - ✓ `/api/admin/users/*` - 92% coverage
   - ⚠ `/api/user/preferences` - 88% coverage

3. URL Management
   - ✓ `/api/admin/urls/*` - 94% coverage
   - ⚠ `/api/admin/url-groups/*` - 85% coverage

## Test Implementation Status

### Completed Test Suites
```typescript
✓ app/api/admin/app-config/route.test.ts
✓ app/api/admin/stats/route.test.ts
✓ app/api/admin/icons/route.test.ts
✓ app/api/admin/users/route.test.ts
✓ app/api/user/preferences/route.test.ts
```

### Pending Test Suites
```typescript
⚠ app/api/admin/app-config/favicon/route.test.ts
⚠ app/api/admin/app-config/theme/route.test.ts
⚠ app/api/admin/backup/route.test.ts
⚠ app/api/first-run/restore/route.test.ts
⚠ app/api/admin/url-groups/[id]/urls/route.test.ts
```

## Coverage Improvement Plan

### Short-term Goals
1. Implement missing test suites for app configuration endpoints
2. Add GET method tests for user avatar endpoint
3. Complete URL group management endpoint tests

### Medium-term Goals
1. Increase edge case coverage to 80%
2. Reduce flaky test percentage to <1%
3. Implement comprehensive performance testing

### Long-term Goals
1. Achieve 95% coverage across all critical paths
2. Implement automated coverage regression detection
3. Add stress testing for all file operation endpoints

## Best Practices

### Test Categories Required for Each Endpoint

1. Authentication Tests
   ```typescript
   describe("Authentication", () => {
     it("returns 401 when not authenticated")
     it("returns 403 when not authorized")
     it("succeeds with valid token")
   });
   ```

2. Input Validation
   ```typescript
   describe("Input Validation", () => {
     it("validates required fields")
     it("handles invalid input types")
     it("enforces size limits")
   });
   ```

3. Error Handling
   ```typescript
   describe("Error Handling", () => {
     it("handles database errors")
     it("handles network errors")
     it("handles concurrent operations")
   });
   ```

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Coverage Reports
- Generated after each test run
- Tracked in CI/CD pipeline
- Reviewed weekly for regressions

### Performance Metrics
- Response times tracked per endpoint
- Memory usage monitored
- File operation latency measured

### Quality Gates
- 80% minimum coverage for non-critical paths
- 90% minimum coverage for critical paths
- No flaky tests in critical paths
- All edge cases documented and tested

## Next Steps

1. Immediate Actions
   - Implement missing test suites
   - Add edge case coverage
   - Document performance benchmarks

2. Process Improvements
   - Automate coverage reporting
   - Implement test stability monitoring
   - Add performance regression detection

3. Documentation Updates
   - Keep metrics current
   - Document new test patterns
   - Update coverage thresholds
