# Core Infrastructure

## Overview

This feature group encompasses the foundational elements of the application, including project setup, containerization, database design, and initialization processes.

## Purpose and Goals

- Establish a robust Next.js 14+ application structure with TypeScript
- Provide containerized deployment with Docker
- Implement efficient database design with SQLite and Prisma ORM
- Enable automated application initialization

## Key Functionalities

- Next.js 14+ App Router structure
- Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- SQLite database with Prisma ORM integration
- Automated database initialization and seeding
- Environment variable management
- Health check system

## Dependencies

### Core Technologies
- Next.js 15.2.2
- TypeScript
- SQLite
- Prisma ORM
- Docker

### Development Dependencies (// TODO update)
- ESLint
- Material UI packages
- Tailwind CSS

## Status

### Current State
✓ All core infrastructure components are implemented and operational
✓ Docker configuration is complete with production optimizations
✓ Database schema is established with proper relationships
✓ Application initialization process is automated

### Known Limitations
- SQLite concurrent access limitations in containerized environment
- Initial setup requires manual environment variable configuration
