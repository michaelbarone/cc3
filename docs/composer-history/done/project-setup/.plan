## Project Setup & Architecture

### Context

- Need to set up a Next.js 14+ project with App Router
- Require TypeScript for type safety
- Need SQLite with Prisma ORM for data storage
- Require Docker configuration for development and production
- Need to implement folder structure following Next.js best practices

### Plan

Step 1: Project Initialization
[X] Initialize Next.js 15.2.2 project with TypeScript and ESLint
[X] Set up App Router structure
[X] Configure TypeScript for type safety
[X] Implement folder structure following Next.js best practices

Step 2: Database Setup
[X] Install and configure Prisma with SQLite
[X] Create database schema with User, UrlGroup, Url, and UserUrlGroup models
[X] Set up migration system
[X] Create seed scripts

Step 3: UI Framework
[X] Install and configure Material UI
[X] Set up theme provider with light/dark mode support
[X] Create base layout components
[X] Implement responsive design

Step 4: Containerization
[X] Create Dockerfile with multi-stage build
[X] Set up docker-compose.yml for easier deployment
[X] Add entrypoint script for database migration and server startup
[X] Configure proper file permissions and environment variables

### Progress

[X] Next.js 15.2.2 project initialized with TypeScript and ESLint
[X] Implemented App Router structure
[X] Installed Material UI packages and dependencies
[X] Set up theme provider with light/dark mode support
[X] Configured TypeScript with the project setup
[X] Set up SQLite with Prisma ORM
[X] Created database schema with User, UrlGroup, Url, and UserUrlGroup models
[X] Created Dockerfile with multi-stage build
[X] Set up docker-compose.yml for easier deployment
[X] Added entrypoint script for database migration and server startup
[X] Organized components by feature domain
[X] Created necessary directories for app structure

### Database Design
[X] User table (id, username, password_hash (nullable), is_admin, last_active_url, created_at, updated_at)
[X] URL Groups table (id, name, description, created_at, updated_at)
[X] URLs table (id, url_group_id, title, url, icon_path, display_order, created_at, updated_at)
[X] User-URL Group mapping table (user_id, url_group_id, created_at)
