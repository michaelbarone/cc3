## URL Menu State Management

### Context

- Need to implement four specific states for URL menu items:
  1. 'active-loaded': Active button + green dot (visible iframe with content)
  2. 'active-unloaded': Active button, no dot (visible iframe, no content)
  3. 'inactive-loaded': Normal button + green dot (hidden iframe with cached content)
  4. 'inactive-unloaded': Normal button, no dot (hidden iframe, no content)
- All buttons start as 'inactive-unloaded' on app load
- Selected URL button becomes 'active-loaded' when clicked

### Plan

Step 1: State Implementation
[X] Define UrlMenuItemState type with four states
[X] Update button component to handle all states correctly
[X] Implement proper state transitions on click events

Step 2: Iframe Management
[X] Ensure proper iframe src management (empty vs data-src)
[X] Implement content caching for inactive-loaded state
[X] Verify proper state sync between button and iframe
[X] Create unified long press handler using custom hook
[X] Move long press state management to IframeStateContext
[X] Add visual feedback during long press (progress indicator)
[ ] Test visual feedback implementation:
  - Verify progress bar appears during long press
  - Check progress bar styling and transparency
  - Test progress updates are smooth (no stuttering)
  - Verify proper cleanup after long press
[ ] Improve tooltips for long press actions
[ ] Add haptic feedback for mobile devices
[ ] Implement proper cleanup of event listeners
[ ] Test edge cases (rapid clicks, interrupted long press)
[ ] Verify menu button click, long press are managed properly and result in the correct state being set

### Progress

[X] Defined clear requirements for each state
[X] Clarified visual indicators for each state
[X] Implemented proper iframe initialization in inactive-unloaded state
[X] Added automatic content loading for active URLs
[X] Synchronized button states with iframe loading states
[X] Fixed timing issues with iframe content loading
[X] Implemented proper state management for URL activation
[X] Created and implemented useLongPress hook with proper TypeScript types and event handling
[X] Integrated long press state management with IframeStateContext
[X] Added visual progress indicator for long press actions
