  - type: suggest
    message: |
      Rule files should follow these naming conventions:

      1. Start with two digits (00-99) for ordering
      2. Follow with a hyphen
      3. Use kebab-case for the rest of the name
      4. End with .mdc extension

      Examples:
      - 00-cursor-rules-location.mdc
      - 01-conventional-commits.mdc
      - 02-rule-file-structure.mdc
      - 03-rule-file-naming.mdc

      Bad examples:
      - cursorRules.mdc (no numbering, camelCase)
      - 1-rule.mdc (single digit)
      - 001-rule.mdc (three digits)
      - rule-file.mdc (no numbering)
      - 01--rule.mdc (consecutive hyphens)

examples:
  - input: "00-cursor-rules-location.mdc"
    output: "Valid rule file name"

  - input: "01-conventional-commits.mdc"
    output: "Valid rule file name"

  - input: "cursorRules.mdc"
    output: "Invalid: Missing numbering and using camelCase"

  - input: "1-rule.mdc"
    output: "Invalid: Single digit numbering"

  - input: "01--rule.mdc"
    output: "Invalid: Consecutive hyphens"
