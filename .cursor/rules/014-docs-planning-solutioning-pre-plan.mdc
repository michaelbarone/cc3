      5. Plan File Maintenance:
         a) Task Plan Files (.plan):
            - Located in task directory under /docs/working-memory/open/{task-id}/.plan
            - Must be updated in real-time as work progresses
            - Use [X] for completed items, [ ] for pending items
            - Include timestamps for all updates
            ```markdown
            ## Current Status
            ### 2025-03-19 15:45

            **Status**: In Progress
            - [X] Visual Design Updates completed
            - [ ] Accessibility Enhancements pending
            ```

         b) Main Project Plan (plan.md):
            - Located in /docs/working-memory/plan.md
            - Must be synchronized with individual task plans
            - Update task status and milestones immediately when changed
            - Maintain consistent formatting across all sections
            ```markdown
            ### Task Name (In Progress)
            - **Location**: `/docs/working-memory/open/task-name`
            - **Status**: In Progress

            ```

         c) Plan Synchronization Rules:
            - Always update both .plan and plan.md together
            - Never leave plans in inconsistent states
            - Use identical milestone names across both files
            - Maintain same completion status ([X] or [ ]) in both files
            - Include progress summaries in plan.md when updating status

         d) Status Updates:
            - Add new progress entries with timestamps
            - Document completed items immediately
            - Note any blockers or dependencies
            - Update affected documentation
